# how many memory will be used, and will race memory resource with other services 
# running on the same server.
# 
# If rt_virtual_mem_enabled is on, LunarMax takes the controll of memory consumption.
# For example, set rt_max_memory = 28, then at most 256MB = 1 << 28 physical memory will be used. 
# Theoretically on a 64-bit machine, virtual memory has no limitation. 
# We strongly suggest locating the swap space (by rt_vm_swap) on a SSD device for quick page exchange.
